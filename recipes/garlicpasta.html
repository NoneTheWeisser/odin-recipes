    <p>Initially, I developed this recipe as a part of my Valentine's Day Menu series. Which is kinda ironic, because I'm sure most people 
        aren't trying to load up on garlic for this romantic holiday LOL. But, I guess when you've been with your partner for almost 10 years, you embrace the garlic breath.</p>
    <p>Jokes aside, I think a pasta dish just feels right on Valentine's Day. 
        And although this Garlic Parmesan Chicken and Pasta may not be bright pink or red, it does feel comforting and special enough to warrant a spot on your at-home Valentine's Day menu.</p>
    <p>And yet, it's super simple to make…with everything coming together in one pan, so you can spend more time enjoying each other's company. 
        Pair it with some crusty bread, roasted veggies or a side salad for the perfect, balanced meal.</p>

        <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast </li>
        <li>1 tbsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ tsp paprika</li>
        <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For the Pasta</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp avocado oil or olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ jumbo yellow onion diced (1 cup)</li>
        <li>4-6 large cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>8 oz dry penne pasta (normal, gluten free or protein pasta)</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped parsley</li>

    </ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix together the italian seasoning, paprika, salt & pepper. Pat the chicken dry and then rub both sides with the seasoning mixture.
</li>
    <li>Bring a large pan to medium heat. Once hot, add avocado oil. Then, add seasoned chicken and cook for 3-5 minutes per side, until the internal temperature reaches 165F. Remove chicken from the pan and set it aside to rest.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and add more avocado oil and butter. Then, add onion and season it with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, or until beginning to get tender and translucent. Add garlic, stir, and cook for 1 minute longer.</li>
    <li>Deglaze the pan with chicken broth, scraping up all the browned bits stuck to the bottom. Allow the broth to come to a light boil. Then, add the dry pasta and stir to make sure that the pasta is submerged in the broth.</li>
    <li>Cover the pan and cook for 10 minutes or until the pasta is al-dente.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and add in the parmesan, heavy cream and parsley. Stir until the parmesan is melted and the sauce is warm and thickened slightly. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed.</li>
    <li>Slice the cooked chicken into strips and add it into the pan along with the pasta. Toss to combine. Then, serve & enjoy!</li>

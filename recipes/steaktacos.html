        Steak and Cheese Tacos made on the griddle are an easy dinner the whole
        family enjoys! These can be made on a griddle or in a big pan on the
        stove. I like topping them with some Taco Bell Creamy Chipotle Sauce and
        dipping them in sour cream. You can add any of your favorite taco
        toppings!

        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 chopped green peppers</li>
        <li>4 TBSP butter</li>
        <li>Shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
        <li>White corn tortillas tortillas</li>

      <h2>Make the Steak Marinade</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To marinade the steak for Steak and Cheese tacos, start by cutting
          skirt steak against the grain into small pieces. Add the cut up steak
          to a container. I used about 2 pounds of skirt steak, but strip steak
          or sirloin steak would also work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the steak is in a container, it's time to make the marinade! I
          add 1 tbsp minced garlic, 2 tbsp lime juice, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, and
          1 tbsp of olive oil to the steak. Stir well and then season generously
          with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Store in the refrigerator for at least an hour, but the longer it sits
          in the marinade the better! While prepping the marinade, I also like
          to go ahead and chop up one onion and the green peppers. I store them
          in a container in the refrigerator until it is time to cook.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h3>Make Steak and Cheese Tacos</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To make the steak and cheese tacos, heat a couple table spoons of
          butter over medium heat on a griddle or in a pan on the stove. Once
          the butter has melted add the chopped onion and green peppers. Season
          the onions and peppers with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the veggies have started to cook down, drain the marinade from
          the steak and add that to the hot griddle. If cooking this on a stove,
          use a second pan for the steak.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the steak is cooked to your liking and the vegetables are tender
          combine the steak and veggies together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread out 2 more tablespoons of butter and brown tortillas on both
          sides. Add shredded pepperjack cheese to the tops of the tortillas
        </li>
        <li>
          Next add the steak/veggie mixture on top of the cheese. Fold over the
          tortilla and cook the taco on both sides until golden brown and
          crispy.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Tips and FAQs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I used 2 lbs of skirt steak, but you can really use any steak you have
          for this recipe. I've also used strip steak before.
        </li>
        <li>
          I used Shredded Pepper Jack cheese, but any cheese could be used with
          this recipe.
        </li>
        <li>
          Top these with any of your favorite taco toppings! I kept it simple
          with some Taco Bell Creamy Chipotle sauce that I buy from Walmart.
          Fresh Pico de Gallo would be so good on these!

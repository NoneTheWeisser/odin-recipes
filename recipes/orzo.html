    <p>You're going to love this easy, creamy and delicious one-pot orzo made with chicken sausage, onions, spinach and corn topped with grated Parmesan.</p>
    <p>This recipe is perfect for a busy weeknight because it's quick to prepare and only requires one pot for cooking. Plus, it’s packed with flavor from the sausage, spinach, and corn, and the orzo adds a satisfying and creamy texture. I love one pot meals so much I wrote a whole cookbook with one pot dinners! For more one pot recipes try this one pot chicken and rice, one pot spaghetti and meat sauce and this one pot spaghetti puttanesca. I also have a section here with lots of one pot meals.</p>

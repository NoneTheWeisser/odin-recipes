            >“My entire skill set in the kitchen is mistake derived. I have no
            formal training, so anything I know how to do, I know how to do it
            because I screwed up multiple times until I figured out how to do it
            right... And I want to make home cooks less afraid of making
            mistakes in the kitchen and more open to seeing them as learning and
            growing experiences.”
